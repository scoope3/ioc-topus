**Tired of juggling a dozen browser tabs for IOC analysis? IOCTopus is a fast, powerful, GUI-based threat intelligence aggregator that brings the data to you.**

IOCTopus streamlines your workflow by fetching, correlating, and displaying rich data for Indicators of Compromise (IPs, domains, URLs, and file hashes) from the most trusted APIs in threat intelligence.

### Key Features

-   **All-in-One Interface**: Look up IOCs from VirusTotal, urlscan.io, and Validin without leaving the application.
-   **Bulk Analysis**: Feed it a list of IOCs and let it do the hard work, with results neatly organized for review.
-   **Secure API Key Storage**: Your API keys are **encrypted at rest** on your local machine using a master key, so they are never stored in plaintext.
-   **Submit & Detonate**: Submit URLs and files for fresh analysis and sandboxing on VirusTotal and urlscan.io.
-   **Rich, Correlated Data**: View detailed file attributes, network communication, behavioral analysis, and submitted URLs in easy-to-navigate tabs.
-   **Export to CSV**: Easily export all collected data for reporting or further analysis in other tools.

### üõ°Ô∏è Secure by Design: API Key Encryption

We take security seriously. When you enter your API keys into IOCTopus:
1.  A master encryption key is generated and stored securely in your user home directory (`~/.ioc_topus_key`).
2.  Your API keys are encrypted using this master key.
3.  The **encrypted keys** are saved to a local `.env` file.
4.  At runtime, the application decrypts the keys into memory for use.

**Your API keys are never stored in plaintext on your disk.**
